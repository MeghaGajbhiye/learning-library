# Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager Deployment and Configuration

## Introduction
In this 30 mins lab, we will deploy the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager Compute instance using an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace image and configure Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager.

## Step 1. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console

Use the tenancy administrator credentials to sign in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console.

1. Reference your ``Key-Data.txt`` file and locate the tenancy administrator credentials.

2. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console using the following:

* **User name**: ``Tenancy Admin User``

* **Password**: ``Tenancy Admin Password``

## Step 2. Deploy and Configure Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager

You will now create a Resource Manager Stack that will perform the following tasks:

* Create the resources required to deploy the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager. Here is a list of resources which will be created automatically for you:

    a. A compartment

    b. The EBS Cloud Manager IAM group, user and policies to allow the group to operation on the above compartment

    c. Network resources â€“ including a VCN, an internet gateway, subnets, route tables, security lists, and security rules
    
* Deploy a Compute Instance for running the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager

* Configure Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager to work with your OCI Tenancy

1. In the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console navigation menu, select **Resource Manager** and then click **Stacks**.

``After the job succeeds, you will have all the network resources (VCN, load balancer, subnets, and so on) required to deploy the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager Compute instance.``

10. On the **Application Information** tab you will find the details related to the EBS Cloud Manager instance and Load balancer.

11. Copy and paste **Private IP, Public IP, Login URL** and **LB Public IP** to your ``Key-Data.txt``. These variables are needed for the remainder of the procedures in this lab.

## Step 3. Log in to Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager

Before login in to the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager web application, you need to add the **hostname** in the Login URL to your local computer hosts file. 

Follow the instructions below to perform this configuration:

Edit the local ``hosts`` file on your laptop and add an entry. 

  **a. For Windows users**

   i. Navigate to Notepad in your start menu.
    
   ii. Hover over Notepad, right-click, and select the option **Run as Administrator**.
    
   iii. In Notepad, navigate to ``File > Open``.
    
   iv. Browse to ``C:\\Windows\System32\drivers\etc``

   vii. Add the following entry to the very end of the file: ``<Lb Public IP> myebscm.ebshol.org``

   viii. Save the file.

 **b. For Mac users**

   i. Open a Terminal Window.

   ii. Enter the following command: ``$ sudo vi /etc/hosts``

   iii. Go to the last line and add the following entry: ``<LB Public IP> myebscm.ebshol.org``

   iv. Save the file.

Using the Login URL generated previously, log into the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager using your IDCS credentials as found in your ``Key-Data.txt`` file.
